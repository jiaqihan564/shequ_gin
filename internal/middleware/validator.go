package middleware

// This file was intentionally left empty after removing unused middleware functions.
// The validator.go file previously contained ValidateJSON, RequireAuth, and SanitizeInput,
// which were not being used in the application routes.
// AuthMiddleware is used instead of RequireAuth.
